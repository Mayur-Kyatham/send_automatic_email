The Automatic Email Sender is a simple Python script that sends a welcome email to a user. This can be useful for automating the process of sending welcome emails to new users or subscribers.

## Prerequisites

- A Gmail account
- An "App Password" generated for your Gmail account to use for SMTP authentication. You can follow [Google's instructions](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en) to generate an App Password.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `automatic_email.py` file in a text editor.
3. Replace `"Your Gmail Account"` and `"Your App Password"` with your Gmail account and the generated App Password.

   **Note:** Be cautious about sharing scripts with hard-coded sensitive information like passwords. Consider using environment variables or configuration files for production use.
